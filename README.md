# Devops-practice
This is where I try and learn Devops as much as I can
there is big emphasize on Github, Jenkins, Docker in the tutorial i am following, but to my knowledge I know Kafka can also be very handy
so I am creating this and will be linking it to the practice project I am creating in Jenkins
I hope this helps.

as of now i am following the tutorial of edureka
