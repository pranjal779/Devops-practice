tried to follow the text file commads on own, from "Turn off swapoff" step for now not working
maybe will have to either go with virtualbox/ubuntu_box or will have to rewatch and follow along the setup part
but I think it is already done
I just have to setup the K8 dashboard part

3:23:19 talks about some important points
you have cluster, master, slave.... Your master should always have better configuration than your slave.
so for that reason if you are using virtual machine on your host, then you have to ensure that your master has at least 
2 GB of ram and 2 core CPU and your slave should have 2 GB of RAM and atleast 1 core CPU.

try the set part with virtualbox-ubuntu_box setup once.

important timestamps for questions:
3:52:42 explaination of need of auto-scaling, with example.
3:57:44 Kubernetes Features.
